 * now hides the mouse when you press the arrow keys
 * added a button that hides the metalines

 * added the ability to change how much space is between the dots
    - in settings
 

* Bugs to Fix:
 * fix the "d" key bug
 * pdf saving 
    - needs dynamic width and height
    - still segfaulting
    - upside down for some reason
 * instant repeating inside the metabox is off
 * undo with instant repeating lines that aren't ended doesn't work

    
* Suggested Features:
 * consider moving the enter key to some other key 
    - add to settings?
 * fix it so when a line runs out of the original area, it cuts it
    - add to settings
 * add zooming in and out
 * add a camera you can move around
 * maybe have the repeater (somehow) recognize if it's a tesselation, and then have an x and a y setting pop up to specify the overlap.
    - Perhaps have different kinds tesselation presets?
 * allow screen resizing
 * add mirroring
    - 2x, 4x, 8x?
 * add middle click button = X
 * consider changing the name "GeoDoodle" to "The Tesselator"
 * area selector with the mouse (specifically for an eraser)
 * delete my own key repeater for the arrow keys so it will use OpenGl's
 * add capability to use more (or less) than 4 enters to select and area
 * add different shapes to repeat (repeat within a square, triangle, hexagon, etc.)
    - add an option to choose which
 * add lines showing the current progress of the enters area
 * add different colors
    - the ability to color in areas between lines
    - be able to change line colors
 * be able to end (and maybe start?) a line along a different line 
    - use a modifier key to be able to do such
 * add automatic dynamic tesselation repeating
    - add an option to turn it on or off
